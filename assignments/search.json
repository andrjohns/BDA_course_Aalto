You may find an additional discussion about choosing priors in a blog post by Andrew Gelman.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template specific to this assignment (html, qmd, pdf) to help you get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nReading instructions:\n\nThe reading instructions for BDA3 Chapter 1.\nThe reading instructions for BDA3 Chapter 2.\n\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade. All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Inference for binomial proportion\nAlgae status is monitored in 274 sites at Finnish lakes and rivers. The observations for the 2008 algae status at each site are presented in the dataset algae in the aaltobda package (‘0’: no algae, ‘1’: algae present).\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be the probability of a monitoring site having detectable blue-green algae levels and \\(y\\) the observations in algae. Use a binomial model for the observations \\(y\\) and a \\(\\BetaDist(2,10)\\) prior for binomial model parameter \\(\\pi\\) to formulate a Bayesian model. Here it is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\pi\\) as it has already been done in the book and it suffices to refer to that derivation. Also, it is not necessary to write out the distributions; it is sufficient to use label-parameter format, e.g. \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\).\nYour task is to perform Bayesian inference for a binomial model and answer questions based on it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood \\(p(y|\\pi)\\) as a function of \\(\\pi\\),\nthe prior \\(p(\\pi)\\), and\nthe resulting posterior \\(p(\\pi|y)\\).\n\nReport the posterior in the format \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\), where you replace \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) with the correct numerical values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior has Beta form (see equations in BDA3 and in the slides).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about the value of the unknown \\(\\pi\\) according to the observations and your prior knowledge? Summarize your results with a point estimate (i.e. \\(E(\\pi|y)\\)) and a 90% posterior interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior intervals are also called credible intervals and are different from confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the proportion of monitoring sites with detectable algae levels \\(\\pi\\) is smaller than \\(\\pi_0=0.2\\) that is known from historical records?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions are required in order to use this kind of a model with this type of data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need to discuss exchangeability yet, as it is discussed in more detail in BDA3 Chapter 5 and Lecture 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.e)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake prior sensitivity analysis by testing a couple of different reasonable priors and plot the different posteriors.

Sample based estimates are also OK. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong due to a wrong posterior distribution being used. With the right posterior, mean, median, and mode are all approximately ….\nQ7: \nFor the b) part, is the 90% posterior interval reported? Sample based estimate is also OK. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong in the first place. If the posterior was right, the 90% posterior interval is roughly ….\nQ8: \nFor the c) part, is the posterior probability Pr(π&lt;0.2|y) reported? Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong. If the posterior was right, the result should be approximately ….\nQ9: \nFor the d) part, does the report discuss …\n\nNo\nNo, but other reasonable assumptions are discussed\nYes, but not quite right or some missing\nYes\n\nQ10: \nFor the e) part, is there some comparison and discussion of results obtained with alternative prior parameters?\n\nNo\nYes, but the results and conclusions are clearly wrong\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S3: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ11: \nDoes the report include whether AI was used and if was used explanation on how it was used?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ12: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ13: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ14: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports. If you think the report is perfect, and you can’t come up with any suggestions how to improve, you can provide feedback on what you liked and why you think the report is better than yours."

For now, you should solve the assignment without the tools showcased herein.\nThe posterior package’s random variable datatype rvar is a “sample-based representation of random variables” which makes handling of random samples (of draws) such as the ones contained in the above variables p0 and p1 easier. By default, it prints as the mean and standard deviation of the draws, such that rvar(p0) prints as 0.05 ± 0.021 and rvar(p1) prints as 0.1 ± 0.029.\nThe datatype is “designed to […] be able to be used inside data.frame()s and tibble()s, and to be used with distribution visualizations in the ggdist package.” The code below sets up an R data.frame() with the draws in p0 and p1 wrapped in an rvar, and uses that data frame to visualize the draws using ggdist, an R package building on ggplot2 and “designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization”.\nThe below plot, Figure 3 uses ggdist’s stat_dotsinterval(), which by default visualizes\n\nan rvar’s median and central 66% and 95% intervals using a black dot and lines of varying thicknesses as when using ggdist’s stat_pointinterval() and\nan rvar’s draws using grey dots as when using ggdist’s stat_dots():\n\n\nr0 = rvar(p0)\nr1 = rvar(p1)\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv_name=c(\"control\", \"treatment\"), rv=c(r0, r1)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv, y=rv_name) + \n    labs(x=\"probabilities of death\", y=\"patient group\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Probabilities of death for the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nrvars make it easy to compute functions of random variables, such as\n\ndifferences, e.g. \\(p_0 - p_1\\): r0 - r1 computes an rvar which prints as -0.05 ± 0.037, indicating the sample mean and the sample standard deviation of the difference of the probabilities of death,\nproducts, e.g. \\(p_0 \\, p_1\\): r0 * r1 computes an rvar which prints as 0.005 ± 0.0026 which in this case has no great interpretation, or\nthe odds ratios needed in task 3.b).\n\nBelow, in Figure 4, we compute the odds ratios using the rvars and visualize its median, central intervals and draws, as above in Figure 3:\n\nrodds_ratio = (r1/(1-r1))/(r0/(1-r0))\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv=c(rodds_ratio)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv) + \n    labs(x=\"odds ratio\", y=\"relative amount of draws\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Odds ratios of the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Figure 4 to visually check whether the answers you computed for 3.b) make sense.\nThis block showcases advanced tools, which you will be allowed and expected to use after this assignment.

    "text": "1 General information\nThe exercises of this assignment are meant to test whether or not you have sufficient knowledge to participate in the course. The first question checks that you remember basic terms of probability calculus. The second exercise checks your basic computer skills and guides you to learn some R functions. In the last three ones you will first write the math for solving the problems (you can, for example, write the equations in markdown or include a photo of hand written answers), and then implement the final equations in R (and then you can use markmyassignment to check your results). The last question checks that you have found the course book.\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template specific to this assignment to help you get started. You can inspect this and future templates\n\nas a qmd file,\nas a rendered html file\nor as a rendered pdf file\n\nor you can download all template qmd files and some additional files at templates.zip (also available on Aalto JupyterHub under /coursedata).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nReading instructions:\n\nThe reading instructions for BDA3 Chapter 1.\n\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade. All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Basic probability theory notation and terms\nThis can be trivial or you may need to refresh your memory on these concepts (see, e.g. Aalto course First Course in Probability and Statistics).

The test is intended to be an initial screening test for the population in general. A positive result (presence of lung cancer) from the test would be followed up immediately with medication, surgery or more extensive and expensive test. The researchers know from their studies the following facts:\n\nTest gives a positive result in \\(98\\%\\) of the time when the test subject has lung cancer.\nTest gives a negative result in \\(96\\%\\) of the time when the test subject does not have lung cancer.\nIn general population approximately one person in 1000 has lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 4.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers are happy with these preliminary results (about \\(97\\%\\) success rate), and wish to get the test to market as soon as possible. How would you advise them? Base your answer on Bayes’ rule computations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively high false negative (cancer doesn’t get detected) or high false positive (unnecessarily administer medication) rates are typically bad and undesirable in tests.\n\n\n\nHere are some probability values that can help you figure out if you copied the right conditional probabilities from the question.\n\nP(Test gives positive | Subject does not have lung cancer) = \\(4\\%\\)\nP(Test gives positive and Subject has lung cancer) = \\(0.098\\%\\) this is also referred to as the joint probability of test being positive and the subject having lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S4: Bayes’ theorem 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ10: \nIs p(has cancer|test result is positive) computed using Bayes’ formula (or its complement p(does not have cancer|test result is positive))?\nQ11: \nIs the result p(has cancer|test result is positive)=… (or p(does not have cancer|test result is positive)=…)\nQ12: \nIs the result motivated with something like …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Bayes’ theorem 2\nWe have three boxes, A, B, and C.

This is not the true value, see Exercise 1.6, page 28, in BDA3). American male singer-actor Elvis Presley (1935 – 1977) had a twin brother who died in birth.

Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports. If you think the report is perfect, and you can’t come up with any suggestions how to improve, you can provide feedback on what you liked and why you think the report is better than yours."

All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\nInstalling and using CmdStanR:\nSee the Stan demos on how to use Stan in R (or Python). Aalto JupyterHub has working R and CmdStanR/RStan environment and is probably the easiest way to use Stan. * To use CmdStanR in Aalto JupyterHub: library(cmdstanr) set_cmdstan_path('/coursedata/cmdstan')\nThe Aalto Ubuntu desktops also have the necessary libraries installed.]{.aalto}\nTo install Stan on your laptop, run ‘install.packages(\"cmdstanr\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))’ in R. If you encounter problems, see additional answers in FAQ. If you don’t succeed in short amount of time, it is probably easier to use Aalto JupyterHub.\nIf you use Aalto JupyterHub, all necessary packages have been pre-installed. In your laptop, install package cmdstanr. Installation instructions on Linux, Mac and Windows can be found at https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/. Additional useful packages are loo, bayesplot and posterior (but you don’t need these in this assignment). For Python users, PyStan, CmdStanPy, and ArviZ packages are useful.\nStan manual can be found at https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/. From this website, you can also find a lot of other useful material about Stan.\nIf you edit files ending .stan in RStudio, you can click “Check” in the editor toolbar to make syntax check. This can significantly speed-up writing a working Stan model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\nFor posterior statistics of interest, only report digits that are not completely random based on the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE).\nExample: If you estimate \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.234\\) with MCSE(\\(E(\\mu)\\)) = 0.01, then the true expectation is likely to be between \\(1.204\\) and \\(1.264\\), it makes sense to report \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.2\\).\nSee Lecture video 4.1, the chapter notes, and a case study for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyterHub has all the needed packages pre-installed.\nThe following installs and loads the aaltobda package:\n\nif(!require(aaltobda)){\n    install.packages(\"remotes\")\n    remotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n    library(aaltobda)\n}\n\nLoading required package: aaltobda\n\n\nThe following installs and loads the latex2exp package, which allows us to use LaTeX in plots:\n\nif(!require(latex2exp)){\n    install.packages(\"latex2exp\")\n    library(latex2exp)\n}\n\nLoading required package: latex2exp\n\n\nThe following installs and loads the posterior package which imports the rhat_basic() function:\n\nif(!require(posterior)){\n    install.packages(\"posterior\")\n    library(posterior)\n}\n\nLoading required package: posterior\n\n\nThis is posterior version 1.4.0\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'posterior'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:aaltobda':\n\n    mcse_quantile\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    mad, sd, var\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    %in%, match\n\n\nThe following installs and loads the ggplot2 package, the bayesplot package and the dplyr package\n\nif(!require(ggplot2)){\n    install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n    library(ggplot2)\n}\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\nif(!require(bayesplot)){\n    install.packages(\"bayesplot\")\n    library(bayesplot)\n}\n\nLoading required package: bayesplot\n\n\nThis is bayesplot version 1.10.0\n\n\n- Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/bayesplot\n\n\n- bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default()\n\n\n   * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots\n\n\n   * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'bayesplot'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:posterior':\n\n    rhat\n\nif(!require(dplyr)){\n    install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n    library(dplyr)\n}\n\nLoading required package: dplyr\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nif(!require(tidyr)){\n    install.packages(\"tidyr\")\n    library(tidyr)\n}\n\nLoading required package: tidyr\n\n# Some additional set-up to make plots legible\nggplot2::theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14))\nbayesplot::bayesplot_theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 14))\n# register_knitr_engine()\n\nThe following installs and loads the cmdstanr package and tries to install cmdstan.\n\nif(!require(cmdstanr)){\n    install.packages(\"cmdstanr\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n    library(cmdstanr)\n}\n\nLoading required package: cmdstanr\n\n\nThis is cmdstanr version 0.5.3\n\n\n- CmdStanR documentation and vignettes: mc-stan.org/cmdstanr\n\n\n- CmdStan path: /root/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.31.0\n\n\n- CmdStan version: 2.31.0\n\n\n\nA newer version of CmdStan is available.

We will fit a simple linear model to answer two questions of interest:\n\nWhat is the trend of student retention as measured by assignment submissions?\nGiven the submission rates for assignments 1–8, how many students will complete the final 9th assignment (and potentially pass the course)?\n\nThe author has given you the broken Stan code below, which they intend to encode the following linear model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma) &= \\mathrm{const.}\n      & \\text{(improper flat prior)}&\\text{ and}\\\\\np(y|x,\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma) &= p_\\mathrm{normal}(y|\\alpha + \\beta x, \\sigma)\n      & \\text{(normal likelihood)} &\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In both the statistical model above and in the Stan model below, \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\) are vectors of the covariates / predictors (the assignment number) and vectors of the observation (proportions of students who have handed in the respective assignment). \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the unknown scalar intercept, \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the unknown scalar slope and \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\\) is the unknown scalar observation standard deviation. The statistical model further implies \\[\np(y_\\mathrm{pred.}|x_\\mathrm{pred.},\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma) = p_\\mathrm{normal}(y_\\mathrm{pred.}|\\alpha + \\beta x_\\mathrm{pred.}, \\sigma)\n\\] as the predictive distribution for a new observation \\(y_\\mathrm{pred.}\\) at a given new covariate value \\(x_\\mathrm{pred.}\\).\nYou can download the broken stan file from github.\n1data {\n    // number of data points\n    int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; \n    // covariate / predictor\n    vector[N] x; \n    // observations\n    vector[N] y; \n    // number of covariate values to make predictions at\n    int&lt;lower=0&gt; no_predictions;\n    // covariate values to make predictions at\n    vector[no_predictions] x_predictions; \n}\n2parameters {\n    // intercept\n    real alpha; \n    // slope\n    real beta; \n    // the standard deviation should be constrained to be positive\n    real&lt;upper=0&gt; sigma; \n}\n3transformed parameters {\n    // deterministic transformation of parameters and data\n    vector[N] mu = alpha + beta * x // linear model\n}\n4model {\n    // observation model / likelihood\n    y ~ normal(mu, sigma); \n}\n5generated quantities {\n    // compute the means for the covariate values at which to make predictions\n    vector[no_predictions] mu_pred = alpha + beta * x_predictions;\n    // sample from the predictive distribution, a normal(mu_pred, sigma).\n    array[no_predictions] real y_pred = normal_rng(to_array_1d(mu), sigma);\n}\n\n1\n\nThis is Stan’s data block: “The data block is for the declaration of variables that are read in as data. […] Each variable’s value is validated against its declaration as it is read. For example, if a variable sigma is declared as real&lt;lower=0&gt;, then trying to assign it a negative value will raise an error. As a result, data type errors will be caught as early as possible. Similarly, attempts to provide data of the wrong size for a compound data structure will also raise an error.” For more information, follow the link.\n\n2\n\nThis is Stan’s parameters block: “The variables declared in the parameters program block correspond directly to the variables being sampled by Stan’s samplers (HMC and NUTS). From a user’s perspective, the parameters in the program block are the parameters being sampled by Stan.” For more information, follow the link.\n\n3\n\nThis is Stan’s transformed parameters block: “The transformed parameters program block consists of optional variable declarations followed by statements. After the statements are executed, the constraints on the transformed parameters are validated. Any variable declared as a transformed parameter is part of the output produced for draws.” For more information, follow the link.\n\n4\n\nThis is Stan’s model block: “The model program block consists of optional variable declarations followed by statements. The variables in the model block are local variables and are not written as part of the output. […] The statements in the model block typically define the model. This is the block in which probability (sampling notation) statements are allowed.” For more information, follow the link.\n\n5\n\nThis is Stan’s generated quantities block: “The generated quantities program block is rather different than the other blocks. Nothing in the generated quantities block affects the sampled parameter values. The block is executed only after a sample has been generated.” For more information, follow the link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nA normal linear model is actually not the best model to use for this type of data, but we will use it here to illustrate the first step in building up to more appropriate, complicated models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the three mistakes in the code and fix them. Report the original mistakes and your fixes clearly in your report. Include the full corrected Stan code in your report. Verify that sampling was successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find some of the mistakes in the code using Stan syntax checker. If you copy the Stan code to a file ending .stan and open it in RStudio (you can also choose from RStudio menu File\\(\\rightarrow\\)New File\\(\\rightarrow\\)Stan file to create a new Stan file), the editor will show you some syntax errors. More syntax errors might be detected by clicking `Check’ in the bar just above the Stan file in the RStudio editor. Note that some of the errors in the presented Stan code may not be syntax errors.\n\n\n\n\nThe author runs the corrected Stan file using the following R code and plots the returned MCMC sample.

For instructions in reporting your implementation, you can refer to parts 2 c) - g) in Assignment 5. Use the Gaussian prior as in Assignment 4 and 5, that is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha \\\\ \\beta\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\sim\n    \\text{N} \\left( \\mu_0,  \\Sigma_0 \\right), \\qquad\n    \\text{where} \\quad\n     \\mu_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n     \\Sigma_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2^2 & 12 \\\\ 12 & 10^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need Stan functions multi_normal and binomial_logit for implementing the prior and observation model, respectively. In Stan code, it is easiest to declare a variable (say theta) which is a two-element vector so that the first value denotes \\(\\alpha\\) and latter one \\(\\beta\\). This is because the multi_normal function that you need for implementing the prior requires a vector as an input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \\(\\widehat{R}\\) for convergence analysis. You can either use Eq. (11.4) in BDA3 or the later version that can be found in a recent article. You should specify which \\(\\widehat{R}\\) you used. In R the best choice is to use function rhat_basic() or rhat() from the posterior package (see ?posterior::rhat_basic). To check \\(\\widehat{R}\\) and other diagnostics, you can also call fit$summary(), where fit is the fit object returned by Stan’s sampling function. Report the \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values both for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and discuss the convergence of the chains. Briefly explain in your own words how to interpret the obtained \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the draws for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (scatter plot) and include this plot in your report. You can compare the results to Figure 3.3b in BDA3 to verify that your code gives sensible results. Notice though that the results in Figure 3.3b are generated from posterior with a uniform prior, so even when your algorithm works perfectly, the results will look slightly different (although fairly similar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo develop the course and provide feedback to Stan developers, we collect information on which Stan setup you used and whether you had any problems in setting it up or using it.

Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.\nYou can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. Refer to the following section and choose the best installation path for you.\n\nFurther instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux.\nWith Linux things should be self-explanatory enough for the users that self-select to use Linux. For Mac installation instructions should be easy to follow, but do tell if they are not. For Windows, things might get a bit more complicated, but it should be less painful than trying to get Stan to work.\n\n\nIt looks like you’d ideally enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in its second version, see https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Sharing-files-with-host-machine:\n\nFor better performance, it is recommended to set up a Linux distribution on WSL2 and save your files in the Linux file system. See the best practices of Docker Desktop WSL2 backend for details. https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#best-practices\n\nInstruction on how to install it can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install:\n\n\nDevelopers can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.\n\nYou must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below. If you are on earlier versions please see the manual install page.\n\nYou can now install everything you need to run WSL with a single command. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting “Run as administrator”, enter the wsl –install command, then restart your machine.\nwsl --install\nThis command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. (This default distribution can be changed).\nIf you’re running an older build, or just prefer not to use the install command and would like step-by-step directions, see WSL manual installation steps for older versions.\nThe first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you’ll be asked to wait for files to de-compress and be stored on your machine. All future launches should take less than a second."

All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\nFor posterior statistics of interest, only report digits that are not completely random based on the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE).\nExample: If you estimate \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.234\\) with MCSE(\\(E(\\mu)\\)) = 0.01, then the true expectation is likely to be between \\(1.204\\) and \\(1.264\\), it makes sense to report \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.2\\).\nSee Lecture video 4.1, the chapter notes, and a case study for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Bioassay model\nIn this exercise, you will use a dose-response relation model that is used in BDA3 Section 3.7 and in the chapter reading instructions. The used likelihood is the same, but instead of uniform priors, we will use a bivariate normal distribution as the joint prior distribution of the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\nIn the prior distribution for \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\), the marginal distributions are \\(\\alpha \\sim N(0,2^2)\\) and \\(\\beta \\sim N(10,10^2)\\), and the correlation between them is \\(\\mathrm{corr}(\\alpha, \\beta)=0.6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nReport the mean (vector of two values) and covariance (two by two matrix) of the bivariate normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean and covariance of the bivariate normal distribution are a length–\\(2\\) vector and a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix. The elements of the covariance matrix can be computed using the relation of correlation and covariance.\n\n\n\nYou are given 4000 independent draws from the posterior distribution of the model in the dataset bioassay_posterior in the aaltobda package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\nthe mean as well as\n5 \\(\\%\\) and 95 \\(\\%\\) quantiles separately\n\nfor both\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\).\n\nReport also the Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSEs) for the mean and quantile estimates and explain in text what does Monte Carlo standard error mean and how you decided the number of digits to show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is graded as correct only if the number of digits reported is correct. The number of significant digits can be different for the mean and quantile estimates. In some other cases, the number of digits reported can be less than MCSE allows for practical reasons as discussed in the lecture.\nHint:\nQuantiles can be computed with the quantile function. With \\(S\\) draws, the MCSE for \\(\\text{E}[\\theta]\\) is \\(\\sqrt{\\text{Var} [\\theta]/S}\\). MCSE for the quantile estimates can be computed with the mcse_quantile function from the aaltobda package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Bioassay model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nAre the mean and covariance of the prior in a) reported? The correct answers are …:\n\nNot reported\nYes, but they are not correct\nYes, and they are correct\n\nQ4: \nAre the means and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in b) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the means must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers are alpha: mean … and beta: mean ….\n\nNot reported\nYes, but one or both means are incorrect\nYes, and the means are correct\n\nQ5: \nAre the quantiles and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in b) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the quantiles must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers are alpha: 5% quantile …, 95% quantile … and beta: 5% quantile …, 95% quantile ….\n\nNot reported\nYes, but one or more quantiles are incorrect\nYes, and the quantiles are correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Importance sampling\nNow we discard our posterior draws and switch to importance sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing the log importance ratios (log importance weights) when the importance sampling target distribution is the posterior distribution, and the proposal distribution is the prior distribution from a). Explain in words why it’s better to compute log ratios instead of ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-log importance ratios are given by equation (10.3) in the course book. The fact that our proposal distribution is the same as the prior distribution makes this task easier. The logarithm of the likelihood can be computed with the bioassaylp function from the aaltobda package. The data required for the likelihood can be loaded with data(\"bioassay\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing normalized importance ratios from the unnormalized log ratios in c). In other words, exponentiate the log ratios and scale them such that they sum to one. Explain in words what is the effect of exponentiating and scaling so that sum is one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.e)\n\n\n\n\n\nSample 4000 draws of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) from the prior distribution from a). Compute and plot a histogram of the 4000 normalized importance ratios. Use the functions you implemented in c) and d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the function rmvnorm from the aaltobda package for sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.f)\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the importance ratios, compute the importance sampling effective sample size \\(S_{\\text{eff}}\\) and report it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation (10.4) in the course book.\nBDA3 1st (2013) and 2nd (2014) printing have an error for \\(\\tilde{w}(\\theta^s)\\) used in the effective sample size equation (10.4). The normalized weights equation should not have the multiplier S (the normalized weights should sum to one). The later printings, the online version, and the slides have the correct equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.g)\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain in your own words what the importance sampling effective sample size represents. Also explain how the effective sample size is seen in the histogram of the weights that you plotted in e).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.h)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a function for computing the posterior mean using importance sampling, and compute the mean using your 4000 draws. Explain in your own words the computation for importance sampling. Report the means for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), and also the Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSEs) for the mean estimates. Report the number of digits for the means based on the MCSEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values below are only a test case, you need to use 4000 draws for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in the final report.\nUse the same equation for the MCSE of \\(\\text{E}[\\theta]\\) as earlier (\\(\\sqrt{\\text{Var} [\\theta]/S}\\)), but now replace \\(S\\) with \\(S_{\\text{eff}}\\). To compute \\(\\text{Var} [\\theta]\\) with importance sampling, use the identity \\(\\text{Var}[\\theta] = \\text{E}[\\theta^2] - \\text{E}[\\theta]^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S3: Importance sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ6: \nIs the source code for the function in c) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ7: \nIs the source code for the function in d) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ8: \nDoes the histogram in e) look something like this figure? If it is evident that the normalized importance ratios are computed correctly, but the prior was incorrect, you can still grade “Reported and looks similar”.\n\nNot reported\nReported, but looks different\nReported and looks similar\n\nQ9: \nIs the effective sample size in f) reported? The correct range for the effective sample size is between …. However, if it is evident that the effective sample size is computed correctly, but the prior was incorrect, you can still grade “Yes, and it is correct”.\n\nNo\nYes, but it is not correct\nYes, and it is correct\n\nQ10: \nThe correct explanation for g) is roughly the following: …\nQ11: \nWhat is the connection between S_eff and the histogram of weights: … How is the answer?\n\nTotally wrong/has not tried\nSomething is a bit wrong\nExplanation is sensible\n\nQ12: \nIs the source code for the function in h) reported?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ13: \nAre the means and their MCSEs of alpha and beta in h) reported? Note that the number of digits reported for the means must follow the rule given in the assignment. The correct answers should be close to these: alpha: mean … and beta: mean …\n\nNot reported\nYes, but they are incorrect\nYes, and they are correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S4: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ14: \nDoes the report include whether AI was used and if was used explanation on how it was used?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ15: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ16: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ17: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports. If you think the report is perfect, and you can’t come up with any suggestions how to improve, you can provide feedback on what you liked and why you think the report is better than yours."

The Metropolis algorithm is described in BDA3 Chapter 11.2. More information on the bioassay data can be found in Section 3.7 in BDA3, and in Chapter 3 notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement the Metropolis algorithm as an R function for the bioassay data. Use the Gaussian prior as in Assignment 4, that is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha \\\\ \\beta\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\sim\n    \\text{N} \\left( \\mu_0,  \\Sigma_0 \\right), \\qquad\n    \\text{where} \\quad\n     \\mu_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n     \\Sigma_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2^2 & 12 \\\\ 12 & 10^2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute with log-densities. Reasons are explained on BDA3 page 261 and Lecture video 4.1. Remember that \\(p_1/p_0=\\exp(\\log(p_1)-\\log(p_0))\\). For your convenience we have provided functions that will evaluate the log-likelihood for given \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (see bioassaylp() in the aaltobda package). Notice that you still need to add the prior yourself and remember the unnormalized log posterior is simply the sum of log-likelihood and log-prior. For evaluating the log of the Gaussian prior you can use the function dmvnorm from package aaltobda.\nUse a simple (normal) proposal distribution. Example proposals are \\(\\alpha^* \\sim N(\\alpha_{t-1}, \\sigma = 1)\\) and \\(\\beta^* \\sim N(\\beta_{t-1}, \\sigma = 5)\\). There is no need to try to find optimal proposal but test some different values for the jump scale (\\(\\sigma\\)). Remember to report the one you used. Efficient proposals are discussed in BDA3 p. 295–297 (not part of the course). In real-life a pre-run could be made with an automatic adaptive control to adapt the proposal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude in the report the following:\n\nDescribe in your own words in one paragraph the basic idea of the Metropolis algorithm (see BDA3 Section 11.2, and Lecture video 5.1).\nThe proposal distribution (related to jumping rule) you used. Describe briefly in words how you chose the final proposal distribution you used for the reported results.\nThe initial points of your Metropolis chains (or the explicit mechanism for generating them).\nReport the chain length or the number of iterations for each chain. Run the simulations long enough for approximate convergence (see BDA Section 11.4, and Lecture 5.2).\nReport the warm-up length (see BDA Section 11.4, and Lecture 5.2).\nThe number of Metropolis chains used. It is important that multiple Metropolis chains are run for evaluating convergence (see BDA Section 11.4, and Lecture 5.2).\nPlot all chains for \\(\\alpha\\) in a single line-plot. Overlapping the chains in this way helps in visually assessing whether chains have converged or not.\nDo the same for \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn complex scenarios, visual assessment is not sufficient and \\(\\widehat{R}\\) is a more robust indicator of convergence of the Markov chains. Use \\(\\widehat{R}\\) for convergence analysis. You can either use Eq. (11.4) in BDA3 or the more recent version described in the article Rank-normalization, folding, and localization: An improved \\(\\widehat{R}\\) for assessing convergence of MCMC. You should specify which \\(\\widehat{R}\\) you used. In R the best choice is to use function rhat_basic() from the package posterior (this function implements the version described in the above mentioned article). Remember to remove the warm-up sample before computing \\(\\widehat{R}\\). Report the \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) separately. Report the values for the proposal distribution you finally used.\n\nDescribe briefly in your own words the basic idea of \\(\\widehat{R}\\) and how to to interpret the obtained \\(\\widehat{R}\\) values.\nTell whether you obtained good \\(\\widehat{R}\\) with first try, or whether you needed to run more iterations or how did you modify the proposal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the draws for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (scatter plot) and include this plot in your report. You can compare the results to BDA3 Figure 3.3b to verify that your code gives sensible results. Notice though that the results in Figure 3.3b are generated from the posterior with a uniform prior, so even when if your algorithm works perfectly, the results will look slightly different (although fairly similar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Generalized linear model: Bioassay model with Metropolis algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nIs the implementation of density_ratio function included ?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ4: \nIs the implementation of metropolis_bioassay function included ?\n\nNo\nYes\n\nQ5: \n2 a) Is the brief description of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm included (and it’s not complete nonsense)?

    "section": "2.1 Choosing a weakly informative prior by intuition",
    "text": "2.1 Choosing a weakly informative prior by intuition\nTo prepare you for your projects, we will first guide you through two possible processes for choosing a weakly informative prior. It is important that your priors are not informed by data, so ideally, you should not have looked at the dataset yet.\nIn the absence of additional information, we will assume that chick weights at 12 days of age (\\(w\\)) follow a normal distribution: \\[\nw\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu,\\sigma).\n\\] Our task will be to define weakly informative priors for the parameters of the mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\).\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) represents the population or “true” mean chick weight at 12 days, and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the standard-deviation of the current weights \\(w\\) around that population mean. For this exercise, we will be specifying a normal prior for \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\n\\mu\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu_0,\\sigma_0).\n\\]\nIn the above, \\(\\mu_0\\) represents our prior knowledge of what we believe the population weight to be and \\(\\sigma_0\\) represents our level of certainty in this belief. To specify a weakly-informative prior for \\(\\mu\\) we need to select values of \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\sigma_0\\) that imply the range of plausible values that \\(\\mu\\) could take.\nWe can do this by our own intuitive prior knowledge (if such intuition exists), or by searching for external references.\nIn modeling, weakly informed priors are quite subjective, which means that justification for prior choice can be considered more important than the specific choice itself. For the subtasks below, you will not be graded on the accuracy or precision of your numbers, but on your justification of them.

    "text": "2.5 Model comparison using the ELPD\nThere are many ways of comparing models1. Commonly, we evaluate point predictions, such as the mean of the predictive distribution2, or accuracy of the whole posterior predictive. Whether we prioritise point or density predictive accuracy may serve different purposes and lead to different outcomes for model choice 3. It is common, however, to report predictive accuracy via log-scores and point-predictive accuracy via root-mean-squared-error based on the empirical average of the predictive distribution. To cross-validate both metrics on left out observations without need to sample from each leave-one-out posterior, we use Pareto-smoothed importance sampling as discussed in the course materials (see Lecture 9).\nWe start comparing models based on the log-score.

All grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\nInstalling and using CmdStanR:\nSee the Stan demos on how to use Stan in R (or Python). Aalto JupyterHub has working R and CmdStanR/RStan environment and is probably the easiest way to use Stan. * To use CmdStanR in Aalto JupyterHub: library(cmdstanr) set_cmdstan_path('/coursedata/cmdstan')\nThe Aalto Ubuntu desktops also have the necessary libraries installed.]{.aalto}\nTo install Stan on your laptop, run ‘install.packages(\"cmdstanr\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))’ in R. If you encounter problems, see additional answers in FAQ. If you don’t succeed in short amount of time, it is probably easier to use Aalto JupyterHub.\nIf you use Aalto JupyterHub, all necessary packages have been pre-installed. In your laptop, install package cmdstanr. Installation instructions on Linux, Mac and Windows can be found at https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/. Additional useful packages are loo, bayesplot and posterior (but you don’t need these in this assignment). For Python users, PyStan, CmdStanPy, and ArviZ packages are useful.\nStan manual can be found at https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/. From this website, you can also find a lot of other useful material about Stan.\nIf you edit files ending .stan in RStudio, you can click “Check” in the editor toolbar to make syntax check. This can significantly speed-up writing a working Stan model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\nFor posterior statistics of interest, only report digits that are not completely random based on the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE).\nExample: If you estimate \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.234\\) with MCSE(\\(E(\\mu)\\)) = 0.01, then the true expectation is likely to be between \\(1.204\\) and \\(1.264\\), it makes sense to report \\(E(\\mu) \\approx 1.2\\).\nSee Lecture video 4.1, the chapter notes, and a case study for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE RStudio).\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nIf you want to install R and RStudio locally, download R and RStudio.\nThere are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and RStudio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the provided template. The template includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used.\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and submit it in peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. The package is pre-installed in JupyterHub. To install the package on your own system, run the following code (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package markmyassignment (pre-installed in JupyterHub). Information on how to install and use the package can be found in the markmyassignment documentation. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page. These will help to gain deeper understanding of the topic.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in Peergrade. You can set email alerts for the deadlines in Peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.\nYou can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.\nDo not share your answers publicly.\nDo not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.\nUse of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching).\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs, almost empty PDFs, copy of the questions, nonsense generated by yourself or AI, as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or nonsense submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank nor nonsense?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\nThis exercise is an example of a decision analysis (DA). In a broad context, this means optimizing over different decisions that lead to different outcomes that all have different utilities. In a Bayesian context, this means using posterior distributions to make decisions.\n\n\n2 Escaping from the chicken coop\nYou are an adult chicken living in an organic chicken commune, where life is great, if a bit boring. You have settled in comfortably, but you want something more for your offspring. Your traveling corvid friends tell you of places where chickens eat corn all day, get ferried around in mobile chicken coops to see the world or get mental stimulation by being trained humanely to perform tricks. The chicken elders have gained access to the computers of your human caretakers and have found the results of a complicated statistical analysis of the growth curves of your relatives. Because you are a chicken, you don’t care about convergence diagnostics or priors.\nYour task is to maximizes the chance of escape for your offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute and visualize the expected chicken weight for days 1–40 per diet, according to the model provided in the template. Do the predictions look reasonable? Why/why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sample a “new chicken” from the posterior, use posterior_predict with options newdata=..., allow_new_levels=TRUE, sample_new_levels=\"gaussian\", where you pass a dataframe as newdata which has a “new” chicken ID Chick and appropriate values for Time and Diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubrubric 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nDoes the plot look right and is it readable?\nQ4: \nHas it been recognized that the prediction time …?\n\n\n\n\nYour chicken elders have been meticulously collecting data on what kind of characteristics have allowed previous chickens to escape. They have found out that both the age and the weight influence the (daily) probability of escape for a chicken:\n\nIf the chicken is too young, it is not yet mature enough to venture out into the world.\nIf the chicken is too old, it will not try to escape anymore.\nIf the chicken is small and has just the right size, it can try to squeze through a tiny crack in the fence.\nIf the chicken is big enough, it is strong enough to try to fly over the fence.\nNo matter the size, there is always a small residual probability that the chicken can escape.\n\nEvery day, chickens will try to escape if they are of the right age. Their daily escape probability \\(e(\\text{day}, \\text{weight})\\) is implemented in the daily_probability_of_escape(day, weight) function. The probability that a chicken with daily weights \\(w = (w_1,\\dots,w_N)\\) has not escaped after \\(i+1\\) days can be computed as follows: \\[\n  f_{i+1} = f_i \\, (1 - e(i, w_i))\n\\] The chickenwise_probability_of_escape(weights) computes the probability that a chicken has escaped after length(weights) days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChickenwise probability of escape function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbump &lt;- function(x, loc=0, scale=1){\n  xi = (x - loc) / scale\n  ifelse(abs(xi) &lt; 1, exp(-1/(1-xi^2)), 0.)\n}\ndaily_probability_of_escape &lt;- function(day, weight){\n  # Expects a day and a weight and computes the daily probability of escape \n  bump(day, 30, 10) * (1e-2 + bump(weight, 200, 150)+bump(weight, 700, 150))\n}\nchickenwise_probability_of_escape &lt;- function(weights){\n  # Expects a vector of daily weights from day 1 to N and computes the probability of \n  # escape at the end of the time series\n  prob_of_failure = 1\n  for(day in 1:length(weights)){\n    prob_of_failure = prob_of_failure * (1-daily_probability_of_escape(day, weights[day]))\n  }\n  return(1 - prob_of_failure)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\ndays = 1:40\nweights = 1:900\nheatmap_matrix = outer(days,weights,daily_probability_of_escape)\nimage(days, weights, heatmap_matrix, xlab=\"day\", ylab=\"weight\", main=\"Daily probability of escape\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily probability of escape for a given day and weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute and visualize the distribution of the chickenwise probabilities of escape per diet, according to the model provided in the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can reuse the predictions you created in the previous subtask.
