# Reporting accuracy

**For posterior statistics of interest, only
report digits that are not completely random based on the Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE).**

*Example:* If you estimate $E(\mu) \approx 1.234$ with MCSE($E(\mu)$)
= 0.01, then the true expectation is likely to be between $1.204$ and
$1.264$, it makes sense to report $E(\mu) \approx 1.2$.

See Lecture video 4.1, [the chapter
notes](../BDA3_notes.html#ch10),
and [a case
study](https://avehtari.github.io/casestudies/Digits/digits.html) for
more information.
