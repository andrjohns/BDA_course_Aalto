For this task, we are interested in modeling the weight of a chick at the age of 12 days.\n\n## Choosing a weakly informative prior by intuition\n\nTo prepare you for your projects, we will first guide you through two possible processes for choosing a weakly informative prior. It is important that your priors are not informed by data, so ideally, *you should not have looked at the dataset yet*.\n\nIn the absence of additional information, we will assume that chick weights at 12 days of age ($w$) follow a normal distribution:\n$$\nw\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu,\\sigma).\n$$\nOur task will be to define weakly informative priors for the parameters of the mean, $\\mu$, and standard deviation, $\\sigma$.\n\nHere, $\\mu$ represents the population or \"true\" mean chick weight at 12 days, and $\\sigma$ represents the standard-deviation of the current weights $w$ around that population mean. For this exercise, we will be specifying a normal prior for $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mu\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu_0,\\sigma_0).\n$$\n\nIn the above, $\\mu_0$ represents our prior knowledge of what we believe the population weight to be and $\\sigma_0$ represents our level of certainty in this belief. To specify a weakly-informative prior for $\\mu$ we need to select values of $\\mu_0$ and $\\sigma_0$ that imply the range of plausible values that $\\mu$ could take.\n\nWe can do this by our own intuitive prior knowledge (if such intuition exists), or by searching for external references.\n\nIn modeling, weakly informed priors are quite subjective, which means that justification for prior choice can be considered more important than the specific choice itself. For the subtasks below, you will not be graded on the accuracy or precision of your numbers, but on your justification of them. The numerical choices you make should make sense and be understandable to an external reviewer of your work (even if they may not agree with your choices).\n\n:::{.subtask letter=a}\nBased on your own past experience and estimation skills, what would you guess is a typical weight range of a fully grown chicken in grams? For example, would it make sense if a chicken weighed 1 million grams? 0.005 grams? What about a chicken that weighed more than you? More than a car? Note that is not important to have a very precise or accurate guess here, the key goal is simply to identify the range of plausible (or at least possible) values.\n\nJustify your choice with 1-3 sentences.\n:::\n\n::::{.subrubric}\n### Weight range by intuition\n\n* Does the chosen range meet the following common sense criteria?\n  * The range is always above **...** and below **...**.\n* Is the justification based on some sort of logic, even if you may disagree?\n::::\n\n:::{.subtask}\nAdjust this range for a 12-day old chick and choose a mean $\\mu_0$ for the weakly informed prior of the parameter $\\mu.$ Justify your adjustment and choice with 1-3 sentences.\n:::\n\n::::{.subrubric}\n### Prior mean by intuition\n\n* Does the chosen prior mean meet the following common sense criteria?\n  * The range is always above **...** and below **...**.\n* Is the justification based on some sort of logic, even if you may disagree?\n::::\n\n:::{.subtask}\nChoosing the standard deviation of a prior requires a little more caution; overconfident (i.e. narrow) priors can have a strong effect on your results,\nwhereas less confident priors are more easily overcome with observed data.\nGiven that overconfidence is a common human bias, a good intuition-based standard deviation should focus on eliminating the impossible values, rather than including the most likely values. Using this constraint, choose a lower and/or upper bound for the weight of any 12-day old chick. Justify your choice with 1-3 sentences.\n:::\n\n:::{.hint}\nDepending on your choice of range above for a \"typical\" chick, this range excluding the impossible values is likely to be wider.\n:::\n\n::::{.subrubric}\n### Prior standard deviation by intuition\n\n* Does the chosen range meet the following common sense criteria?\n  * The range is always above **...** and below **...**.\n* Is the justification based on some sort of logic, even if you may disagree?\n::::\n\n:::{.subtask}\nA common technique recommended in [Prior Choice Recommendations Wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations) considers standardized data, and is that a weakly informed prior should have a standard deviation of an order of magnitude larger than the data.

This technique is more general and doesn't assume you would have prior knowledge.\n\n:::{.subtask}\nConsult a trustworthy source on the weight range of farm chickens, e.g. books, articles, a farmer friend. If the recommended values are for a fully grown chicken, make a reasonable adjustment for a 12-day old chick. What is the weight range of a 12-day old chicken?

In the previous section, you might have noted that with the hierarchical implementation of the model there may be divergent transitions during the sampling from the posterior. This is related to the [Neal's funnel](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/reparameterization.html), where the sampling algorithm would need to change the step size in order to effectively sample the posterior. One trick to improve sampling is to use an alternative parameterization for the model. This parameterization is called the non-centered parameterization (@eq-non-centered) and often it can help with the divergent transitions. In short,In short,\nwe sample parameters from a distribution with an easier geometry for the sample to explore efficiently and then transform those values to the joint distribution of interest.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{i, d} &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\pi(\\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu &= \\mu_0 + z_d \\tau \\\\\nz_d &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1) \\\\\n\\mu_0 &\\sim \\pi(\\mu_0) \\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\pi(\\tau) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-non-centered}\n\nThe hierarchical models made with `brms` use the non-centered parameterization. \nYour tasks are the following:\n\n:::{.subtask letter=a}\nUse the function in the template to make a scatter plot of the posterior draws given the hierarchical model of the population level standard deviation parameter $\\tau$ and the mean parameter of the fourth diet, $\\mu_4$. The possible divergent transitions are highlighted in red. In the report show the plot and comment if there are any divergent transitions.\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.subrubric}\n* Is there a scatter plot of $\\tau$ and $\\mu_4$ and some comments provided in the report?\n  - No scatter plot or comments\n  - The scatter plot is included, and divergent transitions are visible, but not commented on.\n  - The scatter plot and comments on the divergences are included.\n:::\n\nTo sample from the posterior given the same model using `brms`, in the template set the weakly informative priors for the hierarchical model you used in the previous task. `brms` has an internal convention to name model parameters, but the parameter names from @eq-non-centered map into `brms` names with the following logic:\n\n - $\\mu_0$ corresponds to `class=\"Intercept\"`\n - $\\sigma$ corresponds to `class=\"sigma\"`\n - $\\tau$ corresponds to `class=\"sd\"`.\n\n:::{.subtask}\nReplace `normal(0,1)` in the `brm` call in the template with the expressions you had for the priors in your hierarchical Stan model. Then, run the code chunk to sample from the posterior of the hierarchical model using `brms`.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.subrubric}\n* Is the `brms` code shown and do the priors agree with the priors specified above?\n:::\n\n:::{.subtask}\nReport the **posterior expectation for the mean weight of diet 4 $\\mu_4$ with a 90% credible interval**, using the code block in the template.
