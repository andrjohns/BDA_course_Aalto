For this task, we are interested in modeling the weight of a chick at the age of 12 days.\n\n## Choosing a weakly informative prior by intuition\n\nWe will first guide you through two processes for choosing *weakly* informative priors which you can use in your projects as well (though, if expert knowledge is present, we encourage to use that though instead). Many definitions of *weak* exist, but for our purposes, we intend to set priors in this assignment which don't overwhelm the likelihood contributions to the posterior while still exerting some amount of regularisation.\n\nIn the absence of additional information, we will assume that chick weights at 12 days of age ($w$) follow a normal distribution:\n$$\nw\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu,\\sigma).\n$$\nOur task will be to define weakly informative priors for the mean $\\mu$ given observation model standard deviation, $\\sigma$ (a prior distribution for $\\sigma$ will be set in after section 2).\n\nHere, $\\mu$ represents the population mean chick weight at 12 days and $\\sigma$ represents the standard-deviation of the chick weights $w$ around that population mean. For this exercise, we will be specifying a normal prior for $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mu\\sim\\mathcal N (\\mu_0,\\sigma_0).\n$$\n\n$\\mu_0$ represents our prior knowledge of what we believe the population weight to be and $\\sigma_0$ represents our level of certainty in this belief. To specify a weakly-informative prior for $\\mu$ we need to select values of $\\mu_0$ and $\\sigma_0$ that imply the range of plausible values that $\\mu$ could take.\n\nWe can do this by our own intuitive prior knowledge (if such intuition exists), or by searching for external references.\n\nDespite the name, weakly informed priors can be quite subjective ([see for more theoretical discussion here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/entropy-19-00555-v2.pdf)), such that some justification is always needed. For the subtasks below, you will not be graded on the accuracy or precision of your numbers, but on your justification of them. The numerical choices you make should make sense and be understandable to an external reviewer of your work (even if they may not agree with your choices).\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"false\"}\n## A word of caution on eliciting the priors below\nPlease note that in the below, we intend to set a prior on $\\mu$ (the *mean* chick weight), but the intuition we ilicit is based on the weight of *individual* chicks. We do so to help create intuition about what the mean could be, however, it would be theoretically more accurate to ilicit priors about *mean* chick weights. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\nWe have made changes to the assignment text and some of the rubrics to make it clearer.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.subtask letter=a}\nBased on your own past experience and estimation skills, what would you guess is a typical weight range of a fully grown chicken in grams?

In the data file, each column contains the measurements for a single chick at a given point of time.\n\nIn addition to the existing diets, we are interested in the quality of another box of feed (the fifth diet), which a farmer happened to find yesterday at a dark corner of his warehouse.

We will use the following three Gaussian models:\n\n-   a separate model, in which each diet is modeled individually\n-   a pooled model, in which all measurements are combined and there is no distinction between diets\n-   a hierarchical model, which has a hierarchical structure as described in [BDA3](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) Section 11.6\n\nAs in the model described in the book, use the same weight standard deviation $\\sigma$ for all the groups in the hierarchical model. In the separate model, however, use separate weight standard deviation $\\sigma_d$ for each diet $d$. You should use weakly informative priors for all your models.\n\nThe provided Stan code below is given as an example of a separate model. Note that the author has left a comment expressing uncertainty about their prior choices. This separate model can be summarized mathematically as\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mu_{d} &\\sim \\pi(\\mu_d)&&\\text{(diet-wise mean weight),}\\\\\n    \\sigma_d &\\sim \\pi(\\sigma_d)&&\\text{(diet-wise standard deviation of diet-wise chicken weights)},\\\\\n    w_{i,d} &\\sim N(\\mu_d,\\sigma_d)&&\\text{(diet-wise chicken weights)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-separate}\n\nwith priors \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mu_{d} &\\sim N(0,10)&&\\text{(adjust this) and}\\\\\n    \\sigma_d &\\sim\\mathrm{exponential}(.02)&&\\text{(you can keep this).}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-separate-priors}\n\nFor the separate and the pooled models, use one of the weakly informative priors you have derived in 2.1) or 2.2) for the diet-wise mean weights \n$$\\mu_d\\sim \\pi(\\mu_d)=N(\\mu_0,\\sigma_0).$$\nFor the hierarchical model, remember that the parameters in the priors for the diet-wise mean weights itself have to be parameters with their own prior distributions, in our case \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_d &\\sim N(\\mu,\\tau)&&\\text{(diet-wise mean weights)},\\\\\n\\mu &\\sim \\pi(\\mu)&&\\text{(mean of prior for diet-wise mean weights) and}\\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\pi(\\tau)&&\\text{(standard deviation of prior for diet-wise mean weights).}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUse the prior you have used for the diet-wise mean weights $\\mu_d$ in the separate and pooled models for the prior on the mean of the prior for the diet-wise mean weights \n$$\\mu \\sim \\pi(\\mu) = N(\\mu_0,\\sigma_0)$$\nin the hierarchical model and use \n$$\\tau \\sim \\pi(\\tau) = \\mathrm{exponential}(.02)$$ \nfor the prior on the standard deviation of the prior for the diet-wise mean weights.\n\n```{.stan include=\"additional_files/assignment7/chickens_separate.stan\"}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.subtask}\nDescribe the models with mathematical notation (as is done for the separate model above).

In the previous section, you might have noted that with the hierarchical implementation of the model there may be divergent transitions during the sampling from the posterior. This is related to [Neal's funnel](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/reparameterisation.html), where the sampling algorithm would need to change the step size in order to effectively sample the posterior. One trick to improve sampling is to use an alternative parameterisation for the model. This parameterisation is called the non-centered parameterisation (@eq-non-centered) and often it can help with the divergent transitions. \n\nIn short, we sample parameters from a distribution with a potentially easier geometry for the sampler to explore efficiently and then transform those values to the joint distribution of interest.\n\nThe noncentered parameterisation for the hierarchical model using the diet-wise helper parameter $z_d$ becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz_d &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(0, 1)&&\\text{(diet-wise helper parameter)},\\\\\n\\mu_d &= \\mu + z_d \\tau&&\\text{(diet-wise mean weight)},\\\\\n\\mu &\\sim \\pi(\\mu)&&\\text{(mean of prior for diet-wise mean weights),}\\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\pi(\\tau)&&\\text{(standard deviation of prior for diet-wise mean weights),}\\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\pi(\\sigma)&&\\text{(standard deviation of diet-wise chicken weights) and},\\\\\nw_{i, d} &\\sim \\operatorname{normal}(\\mu_d, \\sigma)&&\\text{(chicken weights)}.\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-non-centered}\n\nThe hierarchical models made with `brms` use this non-centered parameterisation. Your tasks are the following:\n\n:::{.subtask letter=a}\nUse the function in the template to make a scatter plot of the posterior draws given the hierarchical model of the population level standard deviation parameter $\\tau$ and the mean parameter of the fourth diet, $\\mu_4$. The possible divergent transitions are highlighted in red. In the report show the plot and comment if there are any divergent transitions.\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.subrubric}\n* Is there a scatter plot of $\\sigma_0$ and $\\mu_4$ and some comments provided in the report?\n  - No scatter plot or comments\n  - The scatter plot is included, and divergent transitions are visible, but not commented on.\n  - The scatter plot and comments on the divergences are included.\n:::\n\nTo sample from the posterior given the same model using `brms`, in the template set the weakly informative priors for the hierarchical model you used in the previous task. `brms` has an internal convention to name model parameters and the parameter names from @eq-non-centered map into `brms` names with the following logic:\n\n - $\\mu$ corresponds to `class=\"Intercept\"`\n - $\\tau$ corresponds to `class=\"sd\"`,\n - $\\sigma$ corresponds to `class=\"sigma\"`.\n \n\n:::{.subtask}\nReplace `normal(0,10)` in the `brm` call in the template with your prior for the population mean \n$$\\mu \\sim \\pi(\\mu) = N(\\mu_0,\\sigma_0)$$ \nyou have derived in 2). Then, run the code chunk to sample from the posterior of the hierarchical model using `brms`.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.subrubric}\n* Is the `brms` code shown and do the priors agree with the priors specified above?\n:::\n\n:::{.subtask}\nReport the **posterior expectation for the mean weight of diet 4 $\\mu_4$ with a 90% credible interval**, using the code block in the template.

It also might be that no clear pattern can be seen.\n - Does centered parameterisation have problems sampling from some specific region of the parameter space compared to the non-centered parameterisation.\n:::\n::: {.subrubric}\n* Has it been discussed which parameterisation resulted in fewer divergent transitions?\n* Has it been discussed for which values of $\\tau$ the divergences occurred?\n* Has it been discussed whether/where the centered parameterisation has problems sampling?\n:::\n\n\n# Overall quality of the report\n\n::: {.rubric weight=7.5}\n\n* Does the report include comment on whether AI was used, and if AI was used, explanation on how it was used?\n    - No\n    - Yes\n* Does the report follow the formatting instructions?\n    - Not at all\n    - Little\n    - Mostly\n    - Yes\n* In case the report doesn't fully follow the general and formatting instructions, specify the instructions that have not been followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference is visible. This will help the other student to improve their reports so that they are easier to read and review.\nIf applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\n* Please also provide feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation, other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty and non-nonsense reports. If you think the report is perfect, and you can’t come up with any suggestions how to improve, you can provide feedback on what you liked and why you think some part of the report is better than yours.\n\n\n:::\n\n",
